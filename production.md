# Deploying Django Application in Production with Gunicorn and Nginx on Ubuntu

This guide walks through all the steps we followed to deploy a Django application in production using **Gunicorn** as the WSGI server and **Nginx** as the reverse proxy on an Ubuntu server.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- Ubuntu server (in our case, an EC2 instance with IP: `13.203.216.161`)
- SSH access to the server
- Django application ready and placed in `/home/ubuntu/fraud_detection`
- Python virtual environment set up inside the project directory as `.venv`

---

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv nginx
```

Activate your virtual environment:
```bash
cd ~/fraud_detection
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install Gunicorn:
```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

---

## 3. Test Gunicorn manually

Inside the project directory:
```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 fraud_detection.wsgi:application
```
Visit `http://<your-ip>:8000` to confirm your app runs.

Stop the Gunicorn server by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

---

## 4. Create a systemd Service for Gunicorn

Create the file `/etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=gunicorn daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/fraud_detection
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/fraud_detection/.venv/bin/gunicorn \
          --access-logfile - \
          --workers 3 \
          --bind unix:/home/ubuntu/fraud_detection/gunicorn.sock \
          fraud_detection.wsgi:application

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then reload systemd and enable the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable gunicorn
sudo systemctl start gunicorn
```

Check status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status gunicorn
```

---

## 5. Configure Nginx

Create a config file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/fraud_detection`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name 13.203.216.161;

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location /static/ {
        root /home/ubuntu/fraud_detection;
    }

    location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/home/ubuntu/fraud_detection/gunicorn.sock;
    }
}
```

Enable this config:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/fraud_detection /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

---

## 6. Fix Permission Denied Issue for Socket

The following error in `/var/log/nginx/error.log` indicates a permissions issue:

```
connect() to unix:/home/ubuntu/fraud_detection/gunicorn.sock failed (13: Permission denied)
```

To fix it:
```bash
sudo chmod +x /home/ubuntu
sudo chmod +x /home/ubuntu/fraud_detection
```

This allows Nginx (running as `www-data`) to access the `.sock` file.

Restart services:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

---

## 7. Access the Application

Visit: [http://13.203.216.161/](http://13.203.216.161/)

You should now see your Django application running behind Nginx with Gunicorn as the application server.

# Restarting Django App After EC2 Reboot

If you stop your EC2 instance and start it again later, here is how to restart your Django application so it's accessible via the internet:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. (Optional but Important) **Check Your Public IP**

- **If you're not using an Elastic IP**, your instance's **public IP will change** after stopping and restarting it.
  - You can get the new IP from your AWS EC2 dashboard ‚Üí Instances ‚Üí check "Public IPv4 address".
  - Use that IP in your browser to access the app (e.g., `http://<your-new-ip>/`).
- **If you're using an Elastic IP**, it will stay the same ‚Äî no update needed.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **SSH Into Your EC2 Instance**

From your terminal:

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@<your-ec2-public-ip>
```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **Start the Gunicorn and Nginx Services**

Assuming you set up `gunicorn` and `nginx` with `systemd`:

```bash
# Start gunicorn (if it's not running already)
sudo systemctl start gunicorn

# Start nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

If you're not sure whether they‚Äôre running, check with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status gunicorn
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

You can restart them just to be safe:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

---

## ‚úÖ 4. **Verify It‚Äôs Working**

- Open your browser and go to `http://<your-ec2-public-ip>/`
- You should see your Django app running as expected.

---

## üîÅ (Optional but Recommended): Enable Auto-Start on Reboot

To make sure Gunicorn and Nginx start automatically on reboot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable gunicorn
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```


## Summary

We:
- Installed Gunicorn and set it up as a systemd service
- Configured Nginx to serve as a reverse proxy
- Ensured correct directory permissions for the Unix socket
- Brought our Django app online with a production-grade deployment setup

---

This setup ensures your Django app is efficiently served with high performance and can be managed easily with systemd and Nginx.
