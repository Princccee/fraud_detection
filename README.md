# Fraud Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately identify fraudulent activities in financial transactions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains transaction details, including features such as transaction amount, transaction date, and other relevant information. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fraud_detection.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Fraud_detection
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.

## Model
The project uses various machine learning algorithms to detect fraud, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks

## Results
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are visualized using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
